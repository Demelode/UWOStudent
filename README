python installed on computer

anything else in requirements.txt
you've got to use a terminal to properly develop in django 
    (things like: >> python manage.py runserver)

Use these resources to understanding the language/toolset:

PYTHON TUTORIAL: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm
DJANGO TUTORIAL: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/

Ask me any questions.


PS: I've left the templating and the basic models/views/admin stuff from one 
of my other django projects to give you a working example to get started/context
with. Let me know if you want clarifications on what to look at.

Also, make sure to fork and make your own branch. Lets keep master cleaned.
